Description: medRxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/) is a free online archive and 
    distribution server for complete but unpublished manuscripts (preprints) in
    the medical, clinical, and related health sciences. medrxivr provides 
    programmatic access to a snapshot of the preprints contained on medRxiv,
    which is updated daily. Users can search for relevant records using regular
    expressions and Boolean logic, and can easily download the full-text PDFs
    of preprints matching their search criteria.
