[medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/) is a free online repository for complete but unpublished manuscripts (preprints) in the medical, clinical, and related health sciences. The `medrxivr` package provides programmatic access to metadata (title, authors, date, etc.) on the preprints contained in the repository via the [medRxiv API](https://api.biorxiv.org/) or a maintained static snapshot (see [Data sources](#data-sources).) `medrxivr` also provides functions to search medRxiv records using regular expressions and Boolean logic, in addition to helper functions to export your search results to a .BIB file for easy import to a reference manager and to download the full-text PDFs of relevant preprints.

__Note:__ `medrxivr` is now available as a web-app, which lets you build complex searches via a user-friendly interface, explore the results and export them for screening. In an effort to improve reproducibility, it also creates the code needed to run the search straight from R. The app is available [here.](https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/medrxivr/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package using:

``` {r}
devtools::install_github("mcguinlu/medrxivr")
library(medrxivr)
```

## Usage

### Data sources

`medrixvr` provides two ways to access medRxiv data:  

  - `mx_api_content()` creates a local copy of all data available from the medRxiv API at the time the function is run.
  
  - `mx_snapshot()` provides acces to a static snapshot of the database. The snapshot is created each morning at 6am using `mx_api_content()` and is stored as CSV file in the [medrxivr-data repository](https://github.com/mcguinlu/medrxivr-data). This method does not rely on the API (which can become unavailable during peak usage times) and is usually faster (as it reads data from a CSV rather than having to re-extract it from the API). Discrepancies between the most recent static snapshot and the live database can be assessed using `mx_crosscheck()`.
  
The relationship between the two methods is summarised in the figure below:
  
``` {r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px", out.height = "400px"}

knitr::include_graphics("figs/data_sources.png")
```
  
## Perform a simple search

### Using data from the API

``` {r}

# Get a copy of the database from the live API
medrxiv_data <- mx_api_content()

# Perform a simple search
results <- mx_search(data = medrxiv_data,
                     query ="dementia")

```

### Using the daily snapshot

``` {r}

# Get a copy of the database from the daily snapshot
medrxiv_data <- mx_snapshot()

# Perform a simple search
results <- mx_search(data = medrxiv_data,
                     query ="dementia")

```

## Export records identified by your search to a .BIB file

`medrxivr` provides a helper function to export your search results to a .BIB file so that they can be easily imported into a reference manager (e.g. Zotero, Mendeley)

```{r, eval = FALSE}

mx_export(data = results,
          file = "mx_search_results.bib")

```

### Download PDFs for records returned by your search

Pass the results of your search above to the `mx_download()` function to download a copy of the PDF for each record.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

mx_download(results,        # Object returned by mx_search(), above
            "pdf/",         # Directory to save PDFs to 
            create = TRUE)  # Create the directory if it doesn't exist

```

Detailed guidance, including advice on how to design complex search strategies, is available on the [`medrxivr` website](https://mcguinlu.github.io/medrxivr/)
