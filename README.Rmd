`medrxivr` provides access to a static snapshot of the _medRxiv_ preprint repository, which is automatically updated each morning to capture new records. `medrxivr` also provides functions to search the snapshot using regular expressions and Boolean logic, and provides a helper function to download the full-text PDFs of relevant preprints.

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package using:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mcguinlu/medrxivr")
library(medrxivr)
```

## Example

To get the entire most recent _medRxiv_ snapshot to play around with, use the following command:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}

mx_results <- mx_search("*")

```

For a simple search strategy:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}

mx_results <- mx_search("dementia")

```

To find records that contain one of many keywords:

``` {r, eval=FALSE}

myquery <- c("dementia","vascular","alzheimer's") # Combined with OR

mx_results <- mx_search(myquery)

```

To combine different topic domains (currently, you can have up to 5 topics):

``` {r, eval=FALSE}

topic1  <- c("dementia","vascular","alzheimer's")  # Combined with OR
topic2  <- c("lipids","statins","cholesterol")     # Combined with OR
myquery <- list(topic1, topic2)                    # Combined with AND

mx_results <- mx_search(myquery)

```

To limit by date posted on medRxiv:

```{r}
mx_results <- mx_search("dementia",
                        from.date = 20200101,      # 1st Jan 2020
                        to.date = 20200105)        # 5th Jan 2020
```

To exclude records containing certain terms:

```{r}
mx_results <- mx_search("dementia",
                        NOT = "MCI")
```

To return all versions of a record, rather than just the most recent one:

```{r}
mx_results <- mx_search("dementia",
                        deduplicate = FALSE)
```

## Download PDFs

Pass the results of your search above to the `mx_download()` function to download a copy of the PDF for each record. Note: downloaded PDFs are named using the value of the `node` column in the dataset, which serves as a unique identifier for each record.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

mx_download(mx_results,     # Object returned by mx_search
            "pdf/",         # Directory to save PDFs to 
            create = TRUE)  # Create the directory if it doesn't exist

```
