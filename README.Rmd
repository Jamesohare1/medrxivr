`medrxivr` provides access to a static snapshot of the _medRxiv_ preprint repository, which is automatically updated each morning to capture new records. `medrxivr` also provides functions to search the snapshot using regular expressions and Boolean logic, and provides a helper function to download the full-text PDFs of relevant preprints.

__Note:__ `medrxivr` is now available as a web-app, which lets you build complex searches via a user-friendly interface, explore the results and export them for screening. In an effort to improve reproducibility, it also creates the code needed to run the search straight from R. The app is available [here.](https://mcguinlu.shinyapps.io/medrxivr/)

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package using:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mcguinlu/medrxivr")
library(medrxivr)
```

## Usage

### Perform a simple search

``` {r, eval=FALSE}

mx_results <- mx_search("dementia")

```

### Download PDFs for returned records

Pass the results of your search above to the `mx_download()` function to download a copy of the PDF for each record.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

mx_download(mx_results,     # Object returned by mx_search
            "pdf/",         # Directory to save PDFs to 
            create = TRUE)  # Create the directory if it doesn't exist

```
